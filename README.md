# Discourse Locations Plugin

Forked by nathan-nz to add a button in the user map navigation, which takes the user to their profile.

The Locations Plugin allows you to associate geocoded locations with topics, and list topics with locations on a map. Additionally it allows users to record their position (voluntarily) and this can show up on a map of Users in the Users directory.
